# System Patterns

## How the system is built
- Python-based application using Poetry for dependency management
- Modular structure with separate package (2hjs) and test directories
- Includes Excel file handling (LAMP.xlsx)

## Key technical decisions
- Use of Poetry for dependency management
- Separation of core functionality into 2hjs package
- Inclusion of comprehensive testing directory

## Architecture patterns
- Modular Python package structure
- Separation of concerns between core functionality and tests
- Configuration through .env file
