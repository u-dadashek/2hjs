[Daniel Adashek] Job Search Strategy: A 2HJS-Inspired, Tool-Driven Approach

1. Overview: Daniel Adashek's Strategic Job Search

This isn't just a job search; it's Daniel Adashek's strategic campaign to secure a fulfilling and impactful role. I/Daniel Adashek am applying the core principles of the 2-Hour Job Search (2HJS) — Prioritize, Contact, Convince — to this job search strategy, leveraging my development toolkit and skills. So what? This is about a targeted, efficient search that achieves measurable results through careful planning and strategic action. My/Daniel Adashek's approach is that of a "speedrunner"—using best-in-class tooling and focused action to achieve career goals faster.

2. My Job Search Toolkit: Leveraging Development Resources

My approach is not conventional, it leverages best-in-class tools for development to create a highly efficient job-seeking workflow:

2.1 "Frontend" (Outreach and Presentation):

Framework: React skills (Conceptual) - So What? Allows me to craft responsive messages.

Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (Conceptual) - So What? Enables flexible expression of my skillset.

State Management: Redux/Context API skills (Conceptual) - So What? Ensures consistent messaging.

UI Framework: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS (Conceptual) - So What? Provides a professional presentation.

Authentication: JWT skills (Conceptual) - So What? Ensures security and privacy of my data.

Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress skills (Conceptual) - So What? Refines my core value proposition and ensures that it is well-received.

2.2 Backend (Targeting and Networking):

Language: Python - So What? Used to scrape data and create reports.

Data Analysis: Pandas - So What? For analyzing and segmenting potential employers and contacts.

API Style: RESTful with OpenAPI (Conceptual) - So What? Enables easy integration of my workflow with other programs.

Authentication: JWT, OAuth2 (Conceptual) - So What? Keeps my data secure, and my networking focused.

Testing: Pytest - So What? Allows me to check and refine the efficiency of my data-collection.

2.3 AI Integration:

Integration: VS Code and Local APIs (no specific platform dependency) - So What? AI assistance throughout the job search workflow.

Models: Any models accessible via code. - So What? Provides flexibility and choice in AI models.

So What?: Keeps my job search expenses low and focused.

2.4 Documentation:

Tool: mkdocs - So What? For generating professional reports and summaries.

2.5 Memlog System:

Purpose: Project management, logging, and persistent data storage. So What? Improves organization and keeps my job search on track.

Components:

tasks.log: Ongoing tasks and issues tracking.

api_keys.txt: Secure storage of sensitive information.

stability_checklist.md: Checklist of job search steps to ensure progress.

url_debug_checklist.md: Specific actions to take to fine-tune my networking.

3. Data Flow Architecture: Networking, Analysis, and AI

This shows how my process will work, but with key concepts from the 2HJS instead of technical components.

4. Performance Optimization: Strategic Action, Fast Results

My focus is on efficient and impactful actions, just as if I was optimizing code:

4.1 "Frontend" Optimization (Outreach):

Concise messaging, strategic targeting, targeted communication - So What? Maximizes responses and impact.

Use of the TIARA Framework - So What? Improves the quality of my informational interviews

Careful selection of language and a focus on authentic messaging So What? Reduces rejection, increases conversions.

4.2 "Backend" Optimization (Targeting):

Pandas data analysis - So What? Allows me to prioritize my target employer list and focus on what will get results.

Use of email filters and calendar reminders - So What? Ensures I do not miss any important follow-up deadlines.

AI-driven task management - So What? Allows for daily plan updates and prioritization

5. My Roadmap: A Focused, Data-Driven Path to Success

My job search strategy is aligned with clear short-term goals and a vision for long-term growth.

5.1 Short-term Goals (Focus and Action):

Implement core AI-driven data analysis pipeline - So What? Immediately improves my ability to identify ideal targets.

Develop a base of contacts in my target roles - So What? Grows my professional network and starts building advocates in my target roles

Set up initial metrics dashboard (Memlog) - So What? Starts tracking progress and identifying bottlenecks.

5.2 Mid-term Goals (Expanding Reach):

Integrate AI to enhance outreach - So What? Provides tailored messages and more targeted networking.

Refine my "interview" messaging with AI-powered feedback - So What? Improves my conversion rates in informational interviews.

Implement a clear system for follow-up - So What? Keeps my job search and my networking organized.

5.3 Long-term Vision (Achieving Impact):

Create an "internal referral" marketplace (within my network) - So What? Grows the network for the next step in my career.

Build a community of connections in my target roles - So What? Grows my professional and support networks.

Develop a machine-learning enhanced resume and personal website - So What? Leverages AI to create a better overall representation of my qualifications and experience.

The 2HJS Toolkit: Strategic Tools for a Strategic Search

Excel/Google Sheets: So What? Used for creating and prioritizing my target employer list (LAMP). Creates a data-driven approach to which employers to prioritize.

Outlook/Gmail Calendar: So What? For tracking follow-ups using the 3B7 Routine. Provides a systematic approach to networking.

VS Code: So What? For logging all planning, research, and outreach, as well as for secure storage of sensitive data. Provides a daily method for tracking progress.

Gemini: So What? For daily planning and prioritization. Helps me focus on the most important tasks, daily.

Claude: So What? For AI-driven writing, coding, and strategy work. Leverages AI to ensure that my messaging is high-impact and on-target.

Key Takeaways:

This is not a traditional job search; it's Daniel Adashek's strategic campaign, leveraging my development toolkit and the core principles of 2HJS for maximum efficiency and impact. I am approaching my job search like a software project—with planning, iteration, data analysis, and AI enhancement— to help me secure the best possible outcome. It's about working smart, not just working hard. I am ready to "speedrun" my job search.

This version clearly establishes Daniel Adashek as the subject of the summary and uses a more personal voice with "I" and "My" throughout the descriptions, while still maintaining the technical and strategic elements.
